# Scrabble-Solver
Repository for a scrabble solving script in Python 3

The solver's input format is as follows:

  ***> \<LETTERS>[,FIRST LETTER][,LAST LETTER]***
  
Any of the letters can be replace with a ? to be set as a blank letter

**The word list in dictionary.txt only includes up to seven letter words, as that is the amount of tiles players play with in Scrabble.**

**If there is interest in it, I might add the [OCTWL Long List](scrabbleplayers.org/w/Long_List), which includes words from 7-15(the length of the board) characters long.**
